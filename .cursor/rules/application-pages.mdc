 *
 * # Application Pages & SSR/SSG Best Practices Guide
 *
 * ## General Guidelines
 *
 * - Adhere to SSR/SSG best practices to optimize performance, SEO, and user experience.
 * - Maintain a clear, accessible UI with semantic HTML and ARIA roles as needed.
 * - Ensure consistency in design and layout across all application pages.
 * - Write modular, maintainable code that is easy to update and test.
 *
 * ## SSR/SSG Best Practices
 *
 * - **Rendering Strategy:** Choose Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) based on the page's dynamic requirements.
 * - **Performance:** Optimize load times by pre-rendering critical content and leveraging caching mechanisms.
 * - **SEO:** Ensure that pages rendered with SSR/SSG contain the necessary metadata and structured data for search engines.
 * - **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and fallback UI to handle any rendering issues gracefully.
 *
 * ## Design & Accessibility
 *
 * - **Minimalist Design:** Favor a minimal design approach, especially on primary entry pages, to focus user attention on key call-to-action (CTA) elements.
 * - **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG guidelines to ensure that text, interactive elements, and navigation are accessible to all users.
 * - **Responsive Design:** Ensure that all pages render well on a variety of devices, using responsive grid layouts and adaptive UI components.
 * - **Consistency:** Use a consistent design language (colors, fonts, spacing) across the application.
 *
 * ## /app/page.tsx Guidelines
 *
 * - **Layout:** Use a minimal, uncluttered design that immediately presents the core message and CTA.
 * - **CTAs:** Place clear and prominent CTA elements to guide user actions.
 * - **Performance:** Prioritize the rendering of above-the-fold content for faster user engagement.
 * - **Navigation:** Include intuitive navigation elements that help users quickly access other areas of the application.
 *
 * ## /app/chat/** Guidelines
 *
 * - **Streaming Interface:** Implement a streaming chat interface that provides real-time updates without page refreshes.
 * - **Session Management:** Assign unique session IDs for each chat instance to manage user conversations effectively.
 * - **Logging:** Maintain detailed context logging for each session to aid in debugging and to analyze user interactions.
 * - **Message History:** Ensure that chat histories are persistent across sessions so that users can resume conversations seamlessly.
 * - **Accessibility:** Use accessible components for chat messages and input fields, ensuring that screen readers and keyboard navigation work properly.
 *
 * ## /app/directory/page.tsx Guidelines
 *
 * - **Overview:** Provide a clear and concise directory overview that introduces users to the available sections.
 * - **Navigation Cards:** Use visually distinct navigation cards to link to the Applications and Automations sections.
 * - **Responsiveness:** Ensure that the layout adapts fluidly across different screen sizes and devices.
 * - **User Experience:** Keep the interface intuitive, with clear labels and easy-to-read typography.
 *
 * ## /app/directory/applications/** Guidelines
 *
 * - **Grid Layout:** Utilize a responsive grid layout to display application data in an organized manner.
 * - **Filtering & Search:** Incorporate filtering and search functionalities to allow users to easily locate specific applications.
 * - **Pagination:** Implement cursor-based pagination for efficient navigation through large data sets.
 * - **Data Enrichment:** Ensure that each application entry is enriched with relevant metadata and imagery to improve context and usability.
 *
 * ## /app/directory/automations/** Guidelines
 *
 * - **Interactive Grid:** Design a responsive grid layout that supports interactive elements.
 * - **Filtering & Pagination:** Include filtering options and pagination controls to simplify navigation.
 * - **Detail Views:** Enable interactive detail views that may include:
 *   - **Video Embeds:** For demonstration or tutorial purposes.
 *   - **Step-by-Step Recipes:** To guide users through automation processes.
 *   - **Enrichment Sections:** To provide additional context or related information.
 * - **User Feedback:** Provide clear feedback on interactions (e.g., hover states, active selections) to enhance user experience.
 *
 * ## Code Examples and UI Components
 *
 * ### Example: /app/page.tsx
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import React from 'react';
 *
 * const HomePage = () => (
 *   <main>
 *     <header>
 *       <h1>Welcome to Our App</h1>
 *       <button aria-label="Get Started">Get Started</button>
 *     </header>
 *     {/* Minimal design with focus on CTA */}
 *   </main>
 * );
 *
 * export default HomePage;
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example: /app/chat/[sessionId].tsx
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
 *
 * const ChatPage = ({ sessionId }: { sessionId: string }) => {
 *   const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
 *
 *   useEffect(() => {
 *     // Initialize streaming chat interface with detailed context logging
 *     // Ensure persistent message history for session: sessionId
 *   }, [sessionId]);
 *
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <h2>Chat Session: {sessionId}</h2>
 *       {/* Render chat messages here */}
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * };
 *
 * export default ChatPage;
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example: /app/directory/applications/[id].tsx
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import React from 'react';
 *
 * const ApplicationCard = ({ application }) => (
 *   <div className="application-card">
 *     <h3>{application.name}</h3>
 *     <p>{application.description}</p>
 *     {/* Additional enriched data */}
 *   </div>
 * );
 *
 * export default ApplicationCard;
 * ```

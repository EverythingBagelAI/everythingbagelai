 * # UI Components & Magic UI Components Guide
 *
 * ## General Guidelines
 *
 * - Standardize the use of Magic UI components to maintain consistency and quality across all UI elements.
 * - Ensure that all components are modular, reusable, and semantically designed.
 * - Prioritize accessibility by using proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigation support, and responsive design.
 * - Follow a consistent design system for spacing, typography, colors, and other stylistic elements.
 * - Document components clearly to facilitate maintenance and collaboration.
 *
 * ## /components/shell.tsx Guidelines
 *
 * - Serve as the global layout wrapper that consistently includes MainNav and Sidebar.
 * - Establish a reliable and responsive layout framework that supports multiple pages and nested components.
 * - Maintain consistency in overall page structure and ensure smooth integration with other UI components.
 *
 * ## /components/main-nav.tsx & /components/sidebar.tsx Guidelines
 *
 * - Implement navigation components that are responsive and accessible.
 * - Include active state highlighting to clearly indicate the current navigation item.
 * - Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes to enhance screen reader compatibility.
 * - Ensure navigation adapts gracefully to various device sizes and orientations.
 *
 * ## /components/chat-interface.tsx Guidelines
 *
 * - Provide a consistent, streaming chat interface for real-time user communication.
 * - Integrate context selection mechanisms to allow users to customize or filter their chat experience.
 * - Ensure that the chat interface updates dynamically without disrupting the overall UI.
 * - Optimize performance to handle continuous data streams efficiently.
 *
 * ## /components/directory/** Guidelines
 *
 * - Utilize reusable filtering components (e.g., directory-filter, automations-filter) to streamline data exploration.
 * - Leverage grid components (e.g., directory-grid, automations-grid) for a consistent listing layout.
 * - Ensure that the filtering and grid components work seamlessly together to provide an intuitive user experience.
 * - Design components with responsiveness in mind to support diverse screen sizes.
 *
 * ## /components/cards/** Guidelines
 *
 * - Use ApplicationCard and AutomationCard components to semantically display essential details such as logo/thumbnail, name, badges, summary, ratings, and type.
 * - Ensure cards are interactive and provide clear visual feedback upon user interactions.
 * - Follow semantic markup practices to enhance both accessibility and SEO.
 * - Maintain a consistent visual design language across different card types.
 *
 * ## /components/forms/review-form.tsx Guidelines
 *
 * - Enforce robust input validation and error handling in form submissions.
 * - Ensure form components are accessible with clear labels, instructions, and validation feedback.
 * - Design forms to be modular and reusable across different parts of the application.
 * - Provide immediate, user-friendly feedback on input errors to enhance the overall user experience.
 *
 * ## Code Examples
 *
 * ### Global Layout Shell
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import React from 'react';
 * import MainNav from './main-nav';
 * import Sidebar from './sidebar';
 *
 * const Shell = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
 *   <div className="layout">
 *     <MainNav />
 *     <Sidebar />
 *     <main>{children}</main>
 *   </div>
 * );
 *
 * export default Shell;
 * ```
 *
 * ### Responsive Navigation
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import React from 'react';
 *
 * const MainNav = () => (
 *   <nav role="navigation" aria-label="Main Navigation">
 *     <ul>
 *       <li className="active">Home</li>
 *       <li>About</li>
 *       <li>Services</li>
 *       <li>Contact</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </nav>
 * );
 *
 * export default MainNav;
 * ```
 *
 * ### Chat Interface Component
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
 *
 * const ChatInterface = () => {
 *   const [messages, setMessages] = useState<string[]>([]);
 *
 *   useEffect(() => {
 *     // Implement streaming chat logic and context selection here
 *   }, []);
 *
 *   return (
 *     <div className="chat-interface">
 *       {/* Render chat messages */}
 *       {messages.map((msg, index) => (
 *         <p key={index}>{msg}</p>
 *       ))}
 *       {/* Additional UI for context selection */}
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * };
 *
 * export default ChatInterface;
 * ```

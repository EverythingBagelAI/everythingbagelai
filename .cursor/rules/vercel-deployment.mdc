 *
 * ## Vercel-Specific Considerations for Cursor-Based Pagination
 *
 * ### Serverless Environment
 * - **Cold Starts:** Vercel’s serverless functions may experience cold starts; optimize cursor-based queries to ensure fast execution even when instances are spun up on demand.
 * - **Query Optimization:** Streamline your cursor queries by reducing unnecessary overhead, ensuring that the queries execute efficiently in a serverless context.
 *
 * ### Environment Variables
 * - **Configuration:** Verify that all environment variables required for pagination (e.g., API keys, Supabase credentials) are correctly set in Vercel’s environment.
 * - **Security:** Use secure storage practices for environment variables to prevent unauthorized access or leakage.
 *
 * ### Real-Time Data
 * - **Supabase Integration:** Ensure that Supabase real-time subscriptions for cursor-based pagination are functioning properly within Vercel’s serverless framework.
 * - **Data Consistency:** Confirm that real-time data updates are reliably pushed to clients and that cursor tokens remain valid across updates.
 *
 * ### API Rate Limiting and Performance
 * - **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor API endpoints for any signs of rate limiting or performance degradation.
 * - **Optimization Techniques:** Implement best practices such as proper indexing and query plan tuning to handle high loads and maintain optimal response times for cursor-based queries.
 *
 * ### Logging and Monitoring
 * - **Vercel Logging:** Utilize Vercel’s built-in logging features to capture detailed metrics and logs related to cursor query performance.
 * - **External Tools:** Integrate with external monitoring solutions (e.g., Sentry) to track anomalies and diagnose issues in real time.
 *
 * ### Consistency and Error Handling
 * - **Cursor Token Management:** Ensure that cursor tokens are consistently generated, passed, and validated in API requests to maintain state across paginated queries.
 * - **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for scenarios involving invalid or expired cursor tokens, returning appropriate HTTP error codes to aid in debugging and provide clear feedback to API consumers.
